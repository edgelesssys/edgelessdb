# Configuration
EdgelessDB is configured via environment variables. Add them as flags `-e NAME=value` to the `docker run` command line.

* `EDG_EDB_DATABASE_ADDR`: The network address of the MySQL interface. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:3306`.
* `EDG_EDB_API_ADDR`: The network address of the HTTP REST API. Defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080`.
* `EDG_EDB_CERT_DNS`: The DNS name of the certificates generated by EdgelessDB when running standalone. Usually you only need to configure this if your MySQL client performs TLS hostname verification. As EdgelessDB's certificate is attested, hostname verification isn't required for security.
* `EDG_EDB_DEBUG`: set to `1` to enable debug logging to the terminal. The [manifest](manifest.md) must allow this because logs may leak data.
* `EDG_EDB_LOG_DIR`: like `EDG_EDB_DEBUG`, but log to files. Set this, e.g., to `/log` and mount a host directory by adding `-v /path/to/log:/log` to the `docker run` command line.
* `PCCS_ADDR`: The network address of the [PCCS](../getting-started/install.md#remote-attestation). E.g., set `172.17.0.1:8081` (the gateway of Docker's default network bridge + the default PCCS port) if the PCCS runs on the same host. Keep it unset if running on Azure.
