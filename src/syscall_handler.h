SyscallHandler intercepts filesystem calls and redirects .frm and db.opt files to the store.

MariaDB would usually write different types of files to its data directory. We mount this directory
in memfs for security, excluding the encrypted RocksDB files. However, .frm and db.opt files need
to be persistent. To achieve this, we intercept access to them and store them in RocksDB.
